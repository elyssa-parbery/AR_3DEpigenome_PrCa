# Analysing Nascent Transcription Scripts

1. Determining Nascent and Steady RNA States with ChromHMM 

2. Nascent vs Total RNA DGE analysis
Use EdgeR to compute size factors per sample across TT- and Total RNA-Seq.

Compute size factor normalised coverage in 200bp bins using fragment midpoints. 
See modified deeptools function from user thomasopsomer here: https://gist.github.com/thomasopsomer/daae8e75ee43b4f50a01c03926d1d1ae

Call nascent expression as a reciprocal ratio of normalised TT:Total RNA signal

3. DGE on New 4sU labelled RNA vs unlabelled RNA
